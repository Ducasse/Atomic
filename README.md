# Atomic
Pharo game: The objective of the game is to build molecules moving the given atoms.

### Personal note. 
This is a fork because the author took the old version of his code that I was maintaining after he left the community for a couple of years http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~StephaneDucasse/Atomic. Then he "fixed" it but did not tell me what where the changes he did that I could retroffit in the SmalltalkHub repo. And that we can finally recommit nicely as part of the catalog. So I fork his new version in case he will again disappear during some years. Paying attention to people taking care of other software would not hurt.
