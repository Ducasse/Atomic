Atomic is game where you have to build chemical molecules using given atoms.  The goal is to solve a level with as few moves as possible.
  The level is solved when the new molecule has the same structure as shown by the preview molecule (on the top right). In the higher levels, some tactical skill will be neccessary for solving the puzzle.
It has been originally implemented by Gustavo Rafael Pistoia.

ToDo:
	- the  bricks should be added to container and not directly to the game morph.
